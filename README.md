#album-cover

A project to procedurally generate covers given

1. A random flikr image - for your album art
2. A random wikipedia article title - for your band name
3. A random quote - for your album title

From [this reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/lplhn/every_band_ever_used_this/)

This project was thrown together over the course of a few hours as part of a contest for Interview Street.  Don't expect much.

Requirements: change the ttffile variable to reference a ttf (true type font) file on your machine.
